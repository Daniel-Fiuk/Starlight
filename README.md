## Contributions
### Daniel Fiuk
Daniel created the magic system and level-generation algorithms and contributed to texturing, modeling, and animation.

The magic system enables players to modify core spells, crafting powerful combinations that can dominate the battlefield through experimentation.

He developed a level-generation algorithm based on the Wave Function Collapse method. It employs a 3D grid of tiles, beginning with a random tile placement and then removing any conflicting tiles. The algorithm then selects the position with the fewest potential tiles and randomly places one of them, repeating this process until the generation "collapses."
